# marchionni_projects

Collaboration with Luigi Marchionni (JHU) and RIKEN with recount data


## Contents

This repository contains the code for running [`recount.bwtool`](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/recount.bwtool) on a set of FANTOM6-derived annotations. In particular, the work by Imada, Sanchez, et al, bioRxiv, 2019 focused on disjoint elements across each strand that you can find at [djnUnstrand](/djnUnstrand). For each of strand (and the combined version) we ran `recount.bwtool` using scripts such as [`djnPos_rse.sh`](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/marchionni_projects/blob/master/djnUnstrand/DjnPos/djnPos_rse.sh). The output was then processed by scripts located in the [eddieimada/fcr2](https://github.com/eddieimada/fcr2) repository.


If you use this data, please cite Imada, Sanchez, et al, bioRxiv, 2019.
